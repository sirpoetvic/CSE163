# Food Desert Analysis
Your answers need to be well thought out. Be specific and clear. Do not be vague nor ambiguous.

## Question 1
**What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access?** 

> Visually, it is a lot easier to see the disparities between the counties which low access. We can see if there are any patterns, and/or trends that happen in specific locations of Washington, focusing on those, more so than others. It can also help us find other underlying causes, like redlining, and other public policy issues, as food access is often stemmed from that. Both functions serve a similar purpose, but one is just more precise on where action could/should be conducted in/at.

## Question 2
**What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?**

> Food isn't always healthy, even if there is a lot of it. Especially in America, low-cost, healthy foods are hard to find, especailly those with low socioeconomic statuses, like the countless communities in the Kent, Seattle, and Tacoma areas. Some meals may also be more fulfilling than others or people in a specific geological area might just be more accustomed to a certain way of living/bodytype. 
 
Additionally, there was a good amount of NaN data that we had to filter out, which I am thinking limits the overall picture of if we are actually representing all of Washington. Oftentimes, those from underserved backgrounds don't fill out surveys for governments to gain information to help them improve, so it's hard to say if they actually need help, or are just not filling out the surveys.
