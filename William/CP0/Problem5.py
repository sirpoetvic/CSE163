"""
Write a function named find_range that accepts a list of integers as a parameter and returns the 
range of values contained in the list.
The range is defined to be one more than the difference between its largest and smallest elements.

For example, consider the list [12, 17, 6]. 
The largest element in this list is 17 and the smallest is 6, so the range is 12 (one more than 17 - 6). 
If the largest and smallest values are the same, the range is 1.
