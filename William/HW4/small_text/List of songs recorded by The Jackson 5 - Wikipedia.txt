The Jackson 5 was an American music group, formed in 1963 by the Jackson family brothers Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon, Michael and Tito. The quintet's first singles were recorded at Steeltown Records, a local label in their hometown of Gary, Indiana. Songs recorded at Steeltown included "You've Changed", "We Don't Have To Be Over 21 (to Fall in Love)" and "Big Boy".[1] According to music journalist Nelson George, Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5's "real" recording history did not begin until their move to Motown Records in 1968.[1] The then Detroit-based company, led by Berry Gordy, housed established recording artists such as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Diana Ross, as well as a producing-writing team known as "The Corporation". Jackson 5 hit singles such as "I Want You Back", "ABC" and "The Love You Save" were written by the Motown team, and aided the five brothers in becoming the first black teen idols.[1]
The success of The Jackson 5 continued throughout the early 1970s, as "Jackson mania" emerged due to the fan frenzy caused by American teens.[1] A notable hit single for the group at this time was "Dancing Machine", a dance song produced by Hal Davis, which also contained elements of the emerging disco sound. Despite the success of the single and their overall success at Motown, four of the Jackson brothers decided to part with the company in 1976, and moved to Epic Records. The group left behind brother Jermaine and the "5" at the end of their name, as they established themselves as "The Jacksons" with the addition of younger sibling Randy.[1] At Epic, the five entered into a two-album collaboration with songwriters Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, who produced "Enjoy Yourself", the biggest success from the partnership.[1]
As Michael Jackson achieved solo success with the studio albums Off the Wall (1979) and Thriller (1982), his musical artistry matured on collaborations with his brothers.[1] The Jacksons' "This Place Hotel"from the siblings' Triumph (1980)contained the singer's first use of sound effects, horror film motifs and vocal trickery to convey a sense of danger to listeners. The song preceded similar large-scale solo productions, such as "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Thriller" and "Smooth Criminal".[1] The singing efforts of Michael and his brothers led to the group being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999.[2][3] Two of the band's recordings ("ABC" and "I Want You Back") are among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll", with the latter track also included in the Grammy Hall of Fame.[2][4]
