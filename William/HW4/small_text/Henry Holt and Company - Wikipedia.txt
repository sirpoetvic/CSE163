History[edit]

The company publishes under several imprints including Metropolitan Books, Times Books, Owl Books and Picador. It also publishes under the name of Holt Paperbacks.
The company has published works by renowned authors Erich Fromm, Paul Auster, Hilary Mantel, Robert Frost, Hermann Hesse, Norman Mailer, Herta Mller, Thomas Pynchon, Robert Louis Stevenson, Ivan Turgenev and H. G. Wells.
From 1951 to 1985, Holt published the magazine Field & Stream.
Holt merged with Rinehart & Company of New York and the John C. Winston Company of Philadelphia in 1960 to become Holt, Rinehart and Winston. The Wall Street Journal reported on March 1 that Holt stockholders had approved the merger, last of the three approvals. "Henry Holt is the surviving concern, but will be known as Holt, Rinehart, Winston, Inc."[2]
CBS purchased the company in 1967. But in 1985 the group split, and the retail publishing arm along with the Holt name was sold to the Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group based in Stuttgart, which has retained Holt as a subsidiary publishing under its original name and in the US it is part of Macmillan Publishers. The educational publishing arm, which retained the Holt, Rinehart and Winston name, was sold to Harcourt.
