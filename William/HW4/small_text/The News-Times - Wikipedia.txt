The News-Times is a daily newspaper based in Danbury, Connecticut, United States. It is owned and operated by the Hearst Corporation, a multinational corporate media conglomerate with $4 billion in revenues.
The paper covers greater Danbury, a city in Fairfield County in southwestern Connecticut. Other towns covered include Brookfield, New Fairfield, Newtown, Bethel, Ridgefield, Redding, Roxbury, New Milford, Sherman and Kent, Connecticut; and Brewster, New York.
In addition to its Danbury headquarters, The News-Times maintains a news bureau in New Milford.
The News-Times also owns and operates The Greater New Milford Spectrum, a weekly newspaper that covers Roxbury, New Milford, Sherman, Kent, Washington and Bridgewater, Connecticut.
History[edit]
The News-Times was founded on September 8, 1883 as the Danbury Evening News by James Montgomery Bailey. In 1933 it merged with the Danbury Times (founded May 17, 1927), thereafter to be known as the Danbury News-Times. The Ottaway Community Newspapers chain purchased the paper in 1955. Ottaway, which later became a division of Dow Jones & Company, owned the newspaper until November 2006, when its sale to Community Newspaper Holdings was announced.[2]
Five months later, on April 1, 2007, the newspaper, along with the weekly Spectrum, was sold for US$75 million to Hearst Corporation of New York. Hearst also owns the Connecticut Post in Bridgeport and the Brooks Community Newspapers chain of weeklies in lower Fairfield County.
Dean Singleton, chairman and chief executive officer of MediaNews, told News-Times employees the paper would remain independent of the larger Connecticut Post, even though the Danbury papers publisher will report to the publisher of the Post, The News-Times reported. MediaNews announced that it will also buy the News-Times building at 333 Main Street, which had not been part of the sale to Community Newspaper Holdings.[3]
On August 8, 2008 the Hearst Corporation acquired the Connecticut Post (Bridgeport, Conn.) and www.ctpost.com, including seven non-daily newspapers, from MediaNews Group, Inc. and assumed management control of three additional daily newspapers in Fairfield County, Conn., including The Advocate (Stamford), Greenwich Time (Greenwich), and The News-Times (Danbury), which had been managed for Hearst by MediaNews under a management agreement that began in April 2007.[4]
