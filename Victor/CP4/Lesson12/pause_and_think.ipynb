    "    that was interesting, that pointed out the \"overfitting\" of data, in which the model trains too closely to the specific given dataset, and how it's necessary\n",
    "    to split off a part of the training and test data. \n",
    "    In addition, it also important to consider the pros and cons to using machine learning as a solution, considering ethics, the realisitic usability of the model,\n",
