# Food Desert Analysis
Your answers need to be well thought out. Be specific and clear. Do not be vague nor ambiguous.

## Question 1
**What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access?** 

> Government officials might use either of these graphs to consider what counties or areas require more government assistance, whether
that be through increase of program funding, other resources, etc. They could also use these graphs to ensure the current programs
are working - if a census tract that previously had funding before is still in the low_access tract, they might need to increase
what they are doing.

## Question 2
**What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?**

> The numbers might just represent the short term impacts that the current resource allocation is providing. In addition, the weights of these graphs are fairly arbitrary - 33% and 500 people being the threshold might not be a good flag - there would need to be more research to make sure that these numbers depict the data well. Also - there are no explanations in what the graph is doing, except the title. It would probably be better suited to have addition information in the legend.
