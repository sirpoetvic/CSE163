History[edit]




Bloomberg Terminal at London City Airport


In 1981, Salomon Brothers was acquired, and Michael Bloomberg, a general partner, was given a $10 million partnership settlement.[12] Bloomberg, having designed in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon, used his $10 million severance check to start Innovative Market Systems (IMS).[13] Bloomberg developed and built his own computerized system to provide real-time market data, financial calculations and other financial analytics to Wall Street firms. In 1983, Merrill Lynch invested $30 million in IMS to help finance the development of "the Bloomberg" terminal computer system and by 1984, IMS was selling machines to all of Merrill Lynch's clients.[13]
In 1986, the company was renamed Bloomberg L.P., and 5,000 terminals had been installed in subscribers' offices.[14] Within a few years, ancillary products including Bloomberg Tradebook (a trading platform), the Bloomberg Messaging Service, and the Bloomberg newswire were launched. Bloomberg launched its news services division in 1990. Bloomberg.com was first established on September 29, 1993 as a financial portal with information on markets, currency conversion, news and events, and Bloomberg Terminal subscriptions.[15]
In late 1996, Bloomberg bought back one-third of Merrill Lynch's 30 percent stake in the company for $200 million, valuing the company at $2 billion. In 2008, facing losses during the financial crisis, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell its remaining 20 percent stake in the company back to Bloomberg Inc.,[16] majority-owned by Michael Bloomberg,[17] for a reported $4.43 billion, valuing Bloomberg L.P. at approximately $22.5 billion.[18][19]
Bloomberg L.P. has remained a private company since its founding; the majority of which is owned by Michael Bloomberg.[18] To run for the position of Mayor of New York against Democrat Mark Green in 2001, Bloomberg gave up his position of CEO and appointed Lex Fenwick as CEO in his stead.[20] Peter Grauer is the chairman.[21] In 2008, Fenwick became the CEO of Bloomberg Ventures, a new venture capital division. Daniel Doctoroff, former deputy mayor in the Bloomberg administration, now serves as president and CEO.[22] In September 2014 it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would be taking the reins of his eponymous market data company from Doctoroff, who was chief executive of Bloomberg for the past six years after his term as deputy mayor.[23]
In September 2014, Bloomberg sold its Bloomberg Sports analysis division to the data analysis firm STATS LLC for a fee rumored to be between $15 million and $20 million.[24]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since its founding, Bloomberg L.P. has made several acquisitions including the radio station WNEW, BusinessWeek magazine, research company New Energy Finance, the Bureau of National Affairs and the financial software company Bloomberg PolarLake. On July 9, 2014, Bloomberg L.P. acquired RTS Realtime Systems, a global provider of low-latency connectivity and trading support services.[25]
WNEW[edit]
In 1992, Bloomberg L.P. purchased New York Radio station WNEW for $13.5 million. The station was converted into an all-news format, known as Bloomberg Radio, and the call letters were changed to WBBR.[26]
BusinessWeek[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. bought a weekly business magazine, BusinessWeek, from McGraw-Hill in 2009. The company acquired the magazinewhich was suffering from declining advertising revenue and limited circulation numbersto attract general business to its media audience composed primarily of terminal subscribers.[27] Following the acquisition, BusinessWeek was renamed Bloomberg Businessweek. Megan Murphy edits the magazine.
Eagle Eye Publishing[edit]
In 2010, Bloomberg L.P acquired Eagle Eye Publishing, a Fairfax, VA-based company that publishes data about procurement by the Federal Government. This acquisition became part of Bloomberg Government which was launched in early 2011.
New Energy Finance[edit]
In 2009, Bloomberg L.P. purchased New Energy Finance, a data company focused on energy investment and carbon markets research based in the United Kingdom.[28] New Energy Finance was created by Michael Liebreich in 2004 to provide news, data and analysis on carbon and clean energy markets. Bloomberg L.P. acquired the company to become an industry resource for information to support low-carbon energy solutions. Liebreich continued to lead the company, serving as the chief executive officer[29] until 2014, when he stepped down as CEO but remained involved as Chairman of the Advisory Board.[30]
Bureau of National Affairs (BNA)[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. purchased Arlington, Virginia-based Bureau of National Affairs in August 2011 for $990 million to bolster its existing Bloomberg Government and Bloomberg Law services.[31] BNA publishes specialized online and print news and information for professionals in business and government. The company produces more than 350 news publications in topic areas that include corporate law and business, employee benefits, employment and labor law, environment, health and safety, health care, human resources, intellectual property, litigation, and tax and accounting.[32]

Products and services[edit]

The Terminal covers both public and private markets globally.[37]
Bloomberg News[edit]
Bloomberg News was co-founded by Michael Bloomberg and Matthew Winkler in 1990 to deliver financial news reporting to Bloomberg terminal subscribers. In 2000, Bloomberg News included more than 2,300 editors and reporters in 100 countries.[38] Content produced by Bloomberg News is disseminated through the Bloomberg terminal, Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg Markets and Bloomberg.com.

Bloomberg Innovation Index[edit]
The Bloomberg Innovation Index is an annual ranking of how innovative countries are. It is based on six criteria: research and development, manufacturing, high-tech companies, post-secondary education, research personnel, and patents.[58][59] Bloomberg uses data from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the OECD and UNESCO to compile the ranking.[60]
Open Bloomberg[edit]
Bloomberg has openly licensed its symbology system (Bloomberg Open Symbology, BSYM), and financial data API (Bloomberg Programming API, BLPAPI).[61]

The office space also includes rows of flat-panel monitors overhead that display news, market data, the weather and Bloomberg customer service statistics.[64]
Leadership[edit]
Bloomberg L.P.'s Management Committee includes Michael Bloomberg, Peter Grauer, and Thomas Secunda.[65]
Litigation[edit]
EEOC v. Bloomberg L.P.[edit]
In September 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a class-action lawsuit against Bloomberg L.P. on behalf of more than 80 female employees who argued that Bloomberg L.P. engaged in discrimination against women who took maternity leave.[66] In August 2011, Judge Loretta A. Preska of the Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the charges, writing that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not present sufficient evidence to support their claim.[67]
In September 2013, Preska dismissed an EEOC lawsuit on behalf of 29 pregnant employees of Bloomberg L.P.[68] In addition, she dismissed pregnancy bias claims from five individual plaintiffs, and allowed part of the case from a sixth plaintiff to proceed.[69]
Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. brought a lawsuit against the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve System (Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to force the Fed to share details about its lending programs during the U.S. Government bailout in 2008.[70] The records documented Federal Reserve loans issued to financial firms and revealed the identities of the firms, the amounts borrowed and the collateral posted in return.[71] Bloomberg L.P. won at the trial court level.[72] The Second Circuit Court ruled in favor of Bloomberg L.P. in March 2010, but the case was appealed to the Supreme Court by a group of large U.S. commercial banks in October. In March 2011, the Supreme Court let stand the Second Circuit Court ruling mandating the release of Fed bailout details.[73]
Bloomberg L.P. v. Bloomberg Ltd[edit]
On October 22, 2008, Bloomberg L.P. applied for a change of name of Bloomberg Ltd, under s.69(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2006. Bloomberg L.P. then amended its name to Bloomberg Finance Three L.P. Bloomberg Ltd was ordered at the Company Names Tribunal on May 11, 2009 to change its name so as to not have a name that would likely interfere, by similarity, with the goodwill of Bloomberg Finance Three L.P. as well as to pay costs.[74]
