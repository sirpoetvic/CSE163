Early life and education[edit]
Gottfried was born in Brooklyn in 1941, to Jewish parents.[2] His father was a successful furrier from Budapest, who had fled Hungary after the July Putsch of 1934. The family moved to Bridgeport shortly after his birth. Gottfried attended Yeshiva University in New York as an undergraduate and returned to Connecticut to attend Yale. He belonged to the Yale Political Unions Party of the Right.[3]
Career[edit]
Gottfried is the author of numerous books and articles detailing the influences which various German thinkers (such as Hegel and Schelling) have exerted on American conservative political theory and other topics, most recently a study of the nature and historiography of fascism. Many of his books also appear in translation.[4] He has also been a friend of many political and intellectual figures, such as Richard Nixon, Pat Buchanan, John Lukacs, Thomas Molnar, Will Herberg, Samuel T. Francis, Paul Piccone, Murray Rothbard, Eugene Genovese, Christopher Lasch, and Robert Nisbet.
Gottfried is a paleoconservative critic of neoconservativism within the Republican Party. In fact, the term paleoconservative was first used by Paul Gottfried and Thomas Fleming, with the "paleo" prefix meaning "old" in opposition to the "neo", or "new", conservatives.[citation needed]
Gottfried is also the first person to use the term "alternative right", when referring specifically to developments within American right-wing politics, in 2008.[5] Richard B. Spencer helped the term gain wide currency with the rise of his so-called "alt-right" movement; Spencer insists that he and Gottfried "co-created" the term.[6]
