Song information[edit]
The song, written and composed by Michael Jackson and Teddy Riley, is about keeping a relationship secret between lovers. "In the closet" is an English idiom used when one is not open about an aspect of their life, particularly in regard to sexual orientation. Despite the song's suggestive name its lyrics do not allude to hidden sexual orientation but rather a concealed relationship; "Don't hide our love / Woman to man." The New York Times stated, "Only Jackson would use that title for a heterosexual love song..."[5] The song's female vocal was originally labeled "Mystery Girl" but was later revealed to be Princess Stphanie of Monaco.[6]
The song, with its heavy industrial-sounding percussion and uptempo arrangement, is typical of producer Teddy Riley's style. The unique, Eastern-influenced backing vocals, reaching crescendo at middle eight imbue the song with an erotic edge usually missing from Jackson's music. With mostly whispered and subdued vocals, embellished with gasps, moans, and shudders, along with lyrics that include "...And if it's aching, you have to rub it," it is generally considered one of Jackson's most provocative songs.
The song was not performed during Jackson's Dangerous World Tour (however, during his concert in Toulouse, the band played a short instrumental before "Man in the Mirror"), but a short version, with the intro of "She Drives Me Wild," was the third song of a medley including "Scream" and "They Don't Care About Us" during the HIStory World Tour. Princess Stphanie's spoken lines were replaced with Jackson's live speech for the sequence.
Critical reception[edit]
AllMusic wrote that this song is fine and there's a lot to be said for professional craftsmanship at its peak and he highlighted it.[7] Robert Christgau praised and described: "he's hawking the most credible sex-and-romance of his career. "In the Closet" implores his mystery woman to keep theirget this--"lust" behind closed doors. Soon he's going wild, or fabricating desperate nostalgia for their used-to-be."[8] Alan Light of Rolling Stone called this song: repressed lust in the titillatingly titled (and determinedly heterosexual)" and he wrote that this song has a "snaky, unexpected bridge."[9]
Collaboration with Madonna[edit]
"In the Closet" was originally conceived as a duet between Jackson and Madonna. According to a 1992 interview with British journalist Jonathan Ross, Madonna said she worked on some lyrical ideas for the song but when she presented them to Michael, he decided they were too provocative and they decided not to continue with the project.[10]
Music video[edit]
The sepia colored music video was directed by Herb Ritts and features Jackson performing sensual dance routines with supermodel Naomi Campbell. The spoken vocals by Princess Stphanie of Monaco were re-recorded by Campbell for the video. The clip was filmed in late March 1992 in Salton Sea, California and premiered on April 23, 1992.[11][12] It was Jackson's most sexually provocative piece and was even banned in South Africa because of its imagery.[13] The video is featured on the DVDs Dangerous: The Short Films and Michael Jackson's Vision. Clips from the music video were used in Jackson's posthumous music video for his song "A Place with No Name", which was released as the second single from his posthumous compilation album Xscape in 2014.
