Biography[edit]
Humberto Gatica was born in 1951 and educated in Chile. One of the most sought-after music producers, engineers, arrangers, and remixers in the entertainment industry, eight-time Grammy Award and five-time Latin Grammy Award winner Humberto Gatica is in demand not only for his pristine technical ability and faultless ear, but also for the passion he brings to every single project he undertakes. His peerless artistry blends the sonic and the creative into an inspiring package that has led some of the best-selling and most beloved artists in the world  including Cher, Celine Dion, Josh Groban, Michael Bubl, Andrea Bocelli, Air Supply, Julio Iglesias, Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand, and Mariah Carey  as well as legendary producers David Foster and Quincy Jones  to want to work with him. Over the course of his nearly four-decade career, the Chilean-born Gatica has had a hand in many landmark, multi-platinum albums and singles including Chicagos 17, Tina Turners Private Dancer, Michael Jacksons Thriller, USA For Africas We Are The World, Celine Dions My Heart Will Go On, Josh Grobans Noel, and Michael Bubles recent No. 1 Crazy Love.[2]
Voces Unidas Por Chile, a group of Latin Americas biggest stars  Shakira, Beto Cuevas, Juanes, Alejandro Sanz, Juan Luis Guerra, Laura Pausini, and Mans Fher Olvera, as well as Michael Bubl  whom Gatica has assembled to record the charity single Gracias A La Vida. Proceeds from its sale will go to the reconstruction efforts in Gaticas native Chile after the destructive earthquake that rocked the country in 2010.[3]
Gaticas other labor of love is producing a set of Spanish-language romantic classics, including Bsame Mucho and Historia de un Amor, sung by his adored uncle Lucho Gatica in duet with such top-notch vocalists as Julio Iglesias, Alejandro Sanz, Luis Miguel, Juanes, and many others. These are passion projects that are truly in keeping with Humberto Gaticas enduring compassionate and creative spirit.[4]
